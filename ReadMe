Here we created a mock project structure using Sass to go about it!

Sass as a preprocessor of css is heavily harnessed here throughout my learning.

Sass is a superset of css. It's mixins, partials, variables, intrapolations and functions manipulations are cute.

I tried to create navbar, menu, about,contact and footer! :)

JS used was majorly to make the menu reactive/functional.

It is fun learning this, kindly check it out.

thank you for sticking around and checking my project!
